This method is detection based method for the MOT. The interesting idear of the method is formularating the mot tracking problem as a **submodular optimization problem**. The experiment has been done on *MOT chanllenge 2015*. It uses deformable part model to obtain the inital detections of frames.


#### The process of the method.
