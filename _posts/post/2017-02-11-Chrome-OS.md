Chrome OS

{:toc}

### Aim
Chromium OS is an open-source project that aims to build an operating system that provides a fast, simple, and more secure computing experience for people who spend most of their time on the web. 

### Chrome OS History
- July 7, 2009 Annonced
- November 19, 2009 Released source code and project
- Junly 15, 2011 Launch
- There are developed little since then

### Personal analysis
I hope this os system will make difference. But these years since 2012, there little contribution made by Chrome OS team. As we know, Microsoft Windows has developed a system for HOLOLENS. If Chrome OS developed slowly, it would be a unreachable dream to be the major system for PC as Android did.
