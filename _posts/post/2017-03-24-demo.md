You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll uses Rouge by default for syntax highlighting, here are some tests.

Ruby:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Python with line numbers:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def print_hi(name):
    print("Hi, {}".format(name))

print_hi('Tom')
# prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

C with line numbers:
{% highlight c linenos %}
void print_hi(string name) {
  printf("Hi, %s", name);
}
print_hi("Tom");
/* prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. */
{% endhighlight %}
